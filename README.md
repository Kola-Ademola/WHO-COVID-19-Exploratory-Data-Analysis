# WHO-COVID-19-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
I decided to do an exporatory analysis of the Covid-19 provided by WHO.  
I focused on Africa for this particuar analysis, and it was an exciting experience and learning process for me.  
The dataset was gotten from the WHO official website and my analysis was done with python using jupyter notebook  
"WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv"  
"covid_data_visualiation.pbix" -- PowerBI visualisation  
"cd_cvd.csv" -- an exported subset from the initial dataset used for visualisation
