I decided to do an exporatory analysis of the Covid-19 provided by WHO.  
I focused on Africa for this particuar analysis, and it was an exciting experience and learning process for me.  
___
## DATA SOURCING
___
The dataset was gotten from the WHO official [website](https://covid19.who.int/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv) and my analysis was done with python using jupyter notebook  
___
## SKILLS DEMONSTRATED & DATA TRANSFORMATION
___
I used python for **data cleaning & data wrangling** before exporting the clean data to Power BI for visualizations.
Libraries used for cleaning in Python;

## CONCLUSIONS & RECCOMMENDATIONS
___
This was a very simple analysis and it helped me gain insight on how COVID-19 has affected the continent because I have always wanted to know how much it affected Africa as compared to other continents, with this I can say not so much but every life is important and my deepest condolonce to all those affected.  
___RECCOMMENDATION___
* From the simple analysis I carried out, **South Africa** is the country mostly affected and I think they should have a much more strict COVID-19 policy in place.
